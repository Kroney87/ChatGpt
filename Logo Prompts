Visual Elements: Picture a sleek, minimalistic hourglass icon. Instead of sand flowing, visualize digital pixels or bits cascading from the top to the bottom. This represents the blend of time and technology, apt for a timer app in the digital age.

Typography: Below the hourglass, incorporate the word "Kronos" in a modern, clean sans-serif font. The letters can have a subtle neon glow or a digital-inspired effect to emphasize the tech aspect.

Color Scheme: Stick to dark shades: deep grays, electric blues, and black. Introduce a vibrant accent color, like a neon cyan or electric purple, to emphasize the digital pixels or bits in the hourglass and the glow on the typography.

Finishing Touch: A matrix or binary code pattern subtly in the background, using the dark color palette, can further reinforce the digital theme.

A hyper-realistic depiction of an antique stopwatch made of polished metal. The stopwatch has a vintage design, reminiscent of the 19th century, with intricate details and engravings. Part of the stopwatch is flipped open, revealing some of its finely-crafted internal gears, springs, and mechanisms. The background against which the stopwatch is set is a muted, uniform grey, which contrasts and highlights the shine and texture of the antique metal. The hour markings on the watch face are represented by digital-style numbers, each glowing in neon blue or purple, giving a fusion of the old and the modern. At the very center of the watch face, the word 'Kronos' is printed in a digital font. This text also glows, either in neon blue or purple, standing out boldly against the otherwise traditional design of the stopwatch
