Visual Elements: Picture a sleek, minimalistic hourglass icon. Instead of sand flowing, visualize digital pixels or bits cascading from the top to the bottom. This represents the blend of time and technology, apt for a timer app in the digital age.

Typography: Below the hourglass, incorporate the word "Kronos" in a modern, clean sans-serif font. The letters can have a subtle neon glow or a digital-inspired effect to emphasize the tech aspect.

Color Scheme: Stick to dark shades: deep grays, electric blues, and black. Introduce a vibrant accent color, like a neon cyan or electric purple, to emphasize the digital pixels or bits in the hourglass and the glow on the typography.

Finishing Touch: A matrix or binary code pattern subtly in the background, using the dark color palette, can further reinforce the digital theme.
